## Overview

### The challenge

Build a full-stack application utilizing Firebase as the database to create a campervan renting website that allows users to view available campervans, as well as a blog section. The goal of this project is to not only create a functional and user-friendly application, but also to optimize it for search engines to achieve the highest SEO scores possible.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Modules
- React
- Next.js
- Redux Toolkit
- Next-Redux-Wrapper
- Jest
- Material UI
- React-Hook-Form
- React-Markdown
- Zod

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use Next.js and Next-Redux-Wrapper to create a server-side rendered React application with a global state management system. I also gained more experience working with Material UI for styling and React-Hook-Form for form validation. Additionally, I learned how to use Jest for testing and Zod for data validation.

### Continued development

To continue the development of this full-stack application, there are several features that can be added to enhance the user experience and improve the functionality of the platform.

Filter and Sorting: Implement filters to allow users to easily sort and narrow down the available campervans based on their preferences, such as price range, location, number of seats, or specific amenities.

Availability Calendar: Create a calendar that displays the availability of each campervan, allowing users to see which dates are already reserved and which ones are still available. This can also help prevent double bookings and ensure that the user's desired rental dates are available.

Payment Processing: Integrate a secure payment system into the platform to allow users to easily make reservations and pay for their rental online. This can include options for various payment methods and currencies.
